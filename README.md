# ForSaleMarketplace - Lister - Android App

This is a marketplace android app I built as a final project during my last semester at UNCW for an app development class. It is built with firebase on the backend for its auth and firestore NoSQL database. The app lets you create, update, delete, and search for posts as well as basic account activities such as creating an account.
